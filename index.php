Indiscriminate fertilizer usage and related environmental and health issues are hot topics in the agriculture sector today. Even with correct usage of chemical fertilizers, about 50 -80% of the applied fertilizers are lost to the environment polluting the environment. In order to minimize losses while protecting the food security and environmental health of the country, the Department of Soil Science, Faculty of Agriculture in collaboration with several other local and foreign institutions, i.e. Rice Research and Development Institute, Batalegoda, Wayamba University of Sri Lanka, The University of Winnipeg and International Plant Nutrition Institute is conducting a target oriented research project with the funding from National Research Council of Sri Lanka (NRC TO-16/07).

This project involved two phases. Phase one of the study involved obtaining the ‘Mobile Mouth Screening Anywhere – MeMoSA’ software and conducting a feasibility pilot study on its usage in Sri Lanka. The functionality of this software is to provide a platform for transmission of oral cavity images and patient details by the dental surgeons to specialists, where the specialist can provide review decisions and management suggestions. This software was developed by Cancer Research Malaysia (CRMY), and its original version is currently being used in Malaysia. The original version was modified by the developers of the CRMY team to suit local requirements according to instructions from the two oral medicine specialists in the research team.

                        <p class="card-text" style=" max-height: calc(1.2em * 20);overflow: hidden;position: relative;">Dengue is one of the deadliest mosquitos borne diseases where Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus act as primary and secondary vectors. Sri Lanka is one country with a record number of annual dengue cases. In the absence of effective treatment for dengue disease, the control of mosquito populations is important in controlling the disease. Use of symbiotic microbes in dengue mosquito control programs is an effective alternative to chemical insecticides as the symbiotic microbes affect the fitness of mosquitoes and thereby the population structure. The aim of this study is to characterize the composition and structure of microbial communities (bacteria and eukaryotes) in Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus in Sri Lanka and identify the microbes that affect the vectorial capacity and fitness of female mosquitoes as well as the larvicidal activity of these microbes. </p>

I believe that this role offers an exceptional opportunity to make a lasting difference to the University's pursuit of excellence in research; to develop and implement strategies and policies to deliver quality research outputs, outcomes, and impacts; and lead and support bidding and winning research grants. I believe that our research will support the country's economic, environmental, cultural, and social development and drive us towards one of the world leaders in research. In recent years, the University has grown significantly in achievement and continues to improve our standing in league tables, particularly in the Times Higher Education World University ranking. While recognizing research is an important component for sustaining our place in these league tables, I will work towards enhancing the multidisciplinary research, as I believe it is our strength within the University.</p>

 </h5>
                        <p class="card-text">Traditional methods of gathering fisheries data can take as long as one or two years, costing time and money that many imperiled global fisheries don’t have.

Enter FishFace, a new application under development by The Nature Conservancy in partnership with Refind Technologies. Similar to facial recognition software used to identify people, FishFace uses artificial intelligence to learn to recognize fish species in photographs.

“When it comes to fisheries management,” Dr. Chris Gillies of The Nature Conservancy in Australia explains, “what sets apart the stocks that aren’t overfished is good data about the size and distribution of those fish.”

FishFace will make fisheries data available in real time. The project is a finalist in the 2016 Google Impact Challenge: Australia with the potential to receive $750,000 in funding to trial FishFace in Indonesia’s snapper and grouper fisheries.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">The chainsaw roars to life and the stench of gasoline fills the air. Steel meets hardwood, and dust pulses from the wound like arterial spray, raining down onto the clay soil as the blade cuts deeper into the massive dipterocarp.

Then the tree groans. It falls — seemingly in slow motion as wood splinters and earth rips — tearing down vines and obliterating smaller trees beneath its bulk. And then comes the silence, punctuated by the dying sputters of the chainsaw.

I’m deep in a logging concession in Indonesian Borneo, and I’ve just witnessed the routine harvesting of a dipterocarp tree bound for the plywood mill. Vast stands of selectively logged forest still remain, but many parts of Indonesia are transitioning from forestry to more intensive land uses, like oil palm and acacia plantations. And with those changes come impacts to the region’s biodiversity and ecosystem services.</p>

</h5>
                        <p class="card-text">Digital technology applied to farm machinery and cloud-based information is making farming seem like science fiction in some places. Drones buzz over the landscape monitoring crop conditions and spotting problems, like pest infestations or weeds. Farmers receive personalized weather information which predicts how rainfall will vary from one field to the next. Soils are mapped at a level of precision unimaginable only a few years ago, and sensors tell farmers exactly how much water is being used at thousands of different data points.

The cabins of farm machinery are filled with GPS systems and drivers no longer drive. Instead, they sit in the cabin checking screens that control the appliances, which move across fields delivering precisely measured quantities of inputs in precisely the best place, at programmed times, in perfectly straight lines or contoured to the land—whatever the data determines will give the best yield.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">“There are some caveats here,” said lead author Michael Levin, “and it’s important to note that there is substantial variation in how much land is likely to be converted at state levels. Some states are projected to see really high levels of development occurring on land with high value for animal movement.”

Scientists note that though solar development is not projected to be a massive driver of land-cover change relative to other drivers, such as agriculture or urbanization, some land covers with higher value for animal movement (deciduous forest in particular) are projected to be converted to solar energy more than other land covers with lower value for animal movement, such as barren lands or intensive agricultural landscapes.   </p>
