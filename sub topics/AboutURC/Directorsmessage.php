            Director's Message
        </h1>
        <p>
        I am delighted to offer this message as the Director of the University Research Council. I believe that this role offers an exceptional opportunity to make a lasting difference to the University's pursuit of excellence in research; to develop and implement strategies and policies to deliver quality research outputs, outcomes, and impacts; and lead and support bidding and winning research grants. I believe that our research will support the country's economic, environmental, cultural, and social development and drive us towards one of the world leaders in research. In recent years, the University has grown significantly in achievement and continues to improve our standing in league tables, particularly in the Times Higher Education World University ranking. While recognizing research is an important component for sustaining our place in these league tables, I will work towards enhancing the multidisciplinary research, as I believe it is our strength within the University.
